# Behavioral-analysis-system-for-malware
The theme of the project is «The development of a prototype system for behavioral analysis of malware
using the DynamoRio dynamic binary toolkit». 

The goal of the thesis project is to increase the speed of detection 
of anti-virus protection methods using malware API calls. 

The thesis project analyzes existing methods and techniques of dynamic analysis of malware,
identifies defects and vulnerabilities, ways to bypass antivirus protection, 
as well as dynamic binary instrumentation tools. 

Threat and vulnerability models of the system under development have been formed. 

This project proposes a modernization of existing approaches to detect 
anti-virus protection methods, based on the analysis of functional objects
by means of dynamic binary instrumentation.
